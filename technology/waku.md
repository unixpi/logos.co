# Waku

Waku is the communications layer of Web3: decentralized, private, secure.

It was born from Whisper, the communications layer introduced with Ethereum. After Whisper was adopted by Status as its communications layer for private and secure chat, it became clear the protocol needed additional development resources to scale how many messages the network could handle, as well as how efficiently the underlying nodes processed indivitual messages (particularly for resource restricted devices like mobile phones). 

Waku is the result of that allocation of resources, resulting in a more modular, extensible, efficient, and scalable suite of protocols for general purpose, secure, private, decentralized message passing. 

Go to the [Waku](https://waku.org) to learn more about how it works, how you can integrate one of the many libraries into your application, or how to contribute to the protocol itself!
